# Computer Vision(CV) / Image Recognition
This computer vision project implements an image recognition model from scratch using the Fastai library. Fastai library helps accelerate training of neural nets with simplified and accurate results. Fastai library was built out of deep learning research at fast.ai . Includes support for collaborative filtering, vision, text and tabular models.

N.B: Small GPUs mat throw an out of memory error
